## Applied Data Science Capstone: Winning Space Race with Data Science
*This is a guided final project from IBM Data Science Professional Certificate programs on Coursera.*


*Upon completion of this project, [IBM Data Science Professional Cerificate](https://coursera.org/share/ea3504ed490dab23019840e83bc1d53c) is earned!*


<br/>

Data analyzed is historical records of rocket launches and landing outcomes in US, together with other recorded features for each launch. 


The ultimate goal is to find a trained machine learning model to predict the landing outcome, while the important features need to be explored first.

<br/>

Data file contains following labels:
- FlightNumber: a numerical label of each rocket launch
- Date: date and time of the rocket launch
- BoosterVersion: version of booster
- LaunchSite: location of the launch
- Payload Mass: amount of mass transported by the rocket
- Orbit: the name of orbit that the rocket launched into
- Launch outcome: success or failure with explanation
- Booster landing: success or failure with explanation
- (More in the data collection source files)

The skills/techniques trained in this guided project are listed below:
1. Data collection from **API** and **WebScraping**, and data wrangling with **NumPy** and **Pandas**
2. Exploratory data analysis with **SQL** on IBM DB2 cloud and visualization with **Mathplotlib** and **Seaborn**
3. Interactive analysis with **Folium** and **Plotly Dash**
4. Training and evaluation of machine learning models (**Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Neighbors Classifier**) to predict landing outcome
